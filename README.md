## Projects: 

- **Deep Learning Using Tensorflow and Keras**

     - [Improvise a Jazz Solo with an LSTM Network](https://github.com/vasukumar92/Improvise-a-Jazz-Solo-with-a-LSTM-Network/blob/master/Improvising%20a%20Jazz%20Solo%20with%20a%20LSTM%20Network.ipynb) : This notebook discusses a model that uses an LSTM to generate music. I applied an LSTM to music generation and Generating jazz music was done with deep learning.
     
     - [Trigger Word Detection for a Laptop using Deep Learning](https://github.com/vasukumar92/Trigger-Word-Detection-for-a-Laptop-using-Deep-Learning/blob/master/Trigger%20Word%20Detection%20using%20Deep%20Learning%20(1).ipynb) : In this notebook, we will construct a speech dataset and implement an algorithm for trigger word detection (sometimes also called keyword detection, or wakeword detection). Trigger word detection is the technology that allows devices like Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Apple Siri, and Baidu DuerOS to wake up upon hearing a certain word. For this exercise, our trigger word will be "Activate." Every time it hears you say "activate," it will make a "chiming" sound. By the end of this assignment, you will be able to record a clip of yourself talking, and have the algorithm trigger a chime when it detects you saying "activate."

     - [Autonomous driving Car detection](https://github.com/vasukumar92/Autonomous-driving---Car-detection/blob/master/Autonomous%2Bdriving%2Bapplication%2B-%2BCar%2Bdetection%2B-%2Bv3.ipynb) : The notebook presents the AI based object detection using the very powerful YOLO model to detect cars, people and other objects.

- **Machine Learning**

     - [Ensemble-Modeling Rare Event Classification](https://github.com/vasukumar92/Ensemble-Modeling-Rare-Event-Classification/blob/master/Ensemble%20Modelling%20incorporating%20Random%20Undersampling.ipynb) : Rare Event Classification (Ensemble Modelling incorporating Random Under-sampling). The data consists of 10,500 credit applications, each classified as good or bad credit. However, there are only 500 bad credit applications. Since this is less than 5% of the data, classifying applicants as bad credit is referred to as a rare event problem. This is also known as anomaly dete ction in many applications. Approach: The best ratio is discovered by trying ratios between 50:50 to 85:15. Build an ensemble model based on the optimum ratio selected. This is done my creating ensemble of trees using the optimum ratio, fitting a model to each, making classification probability predictions for each and then averaging those to get predicted classification probabilities. From that we can calculate the loss totaled over all the trees. The base model is a decision tree with a minimum leaf size is 5, and the minimum split size is 5. The optimum depth for this model is determined by optimizing the F1-score using 10-fold cross-validation.
     
     - [Drone Flight Data Anlaysis and Flight Range Prediciton using Neural Networks](https://github.com/vasukumar92/Drone-Flight-Data-Anlaysis-and-Flight-Range-Prediciton-using-Neural-Networks/blob/master/ZIPLINE.ipynb): Understanding of the flight condition, performance, efficiency is a vital part of a company’s strategy. Analyzing and studying flight details can help a company to direct the use of right type of product at right location/conditions at right time. In this report we would be leveraging Data Analysis techniques to study the flight details, launches, to target the right parts and perform EDA of flight status.

Steps Performed: Importing of text files to python, Text Parsing and transformation operations are performed such as lower case conversion, removal of special characters, contraction words, tokenizing etc., Tagging parts of speech to each term, Stemming terms to get their root word, Stop Word Removal. The project also shows the difference in the outcome when POS Tagging, Stop Word Removal and Stemming operations are not performed.

    - [Prediction Analysis of Risky Credit for a credit card company using Neural Networks and Random Forests](https://github.com/vasukumar92/Prediction-Analysis-of-Risky-Credit-ANN-RF-DT-/blob/master/Credit%20History%20_Risk%20(1).ipynb) : Developed a model to determine the credit risk for a customer based on the attributes. Performed data imputations using one-hot method. The Random Forest model results the accuracy of 78%, Recall of 93.24%, precision of 80.23% and F1 score of 86.25%.

This is a historical customer dataset where each row represents one customer. The data is relatively easy to understand, and you may uncover insights that can be used immediately. Typically it is less expensive to keep customers than acquire new ones, so the focus of this analysis is to predict the customers who will stay with the company.
